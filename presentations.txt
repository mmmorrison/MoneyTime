name change: transportation101


1. My name is Maria Morrison and prior to studying web development I worked in intermodal logistics for 13 years.

2. There are roughly 3.5 million truckers on the road.  They are one backbones of our economy and one of the biggest issues drivers and dispatchers face is delay times.  Whenever a driver has to wait above and beyond the allotted free time it cost the shipper, the consignee, the trucking company and most importantly the driver money.  I created this app to help owner/operators report delays before arrive at destination.

3. I used Meteor for the client side and backend as well as MongoDB for the database and GoogleMaps API.

4. The page is responsive.  Map page shows a visual representations of all the delays reported by the drivers.  On the delay page, the app will use Google's geolocation to add any delays markers to the ramp.

5. This was originally supposed to be a mobile app using the Waze API but I had issues using the API.  I also had to learn Meteor and Mongo in two weeks because of that I wasn't able to add all the features I wanted.
